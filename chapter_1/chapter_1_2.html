<p>So far, we have basically the bestest most killer app of all time.
It says hello to the world, and exits.
It really doesn't get better than that.</p>
<p>Unless...</p>
<p>What if we were to reply back with a random number as well?</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll add a dependency <a href="#whats-the-solution">the workspace way</a>, understand <a href="#best-practices">semantic versioning</a> as it's used in Rust, and get a bit of insight into <a href="#cargolock">the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file</a>.</p>
<p>If you're comfortable with these topics, then head over to <a href="./chapter_1_3.html">Chapter 1.3</a>, where we'll meet everyone's favorite helper, Clippy!</p>
<h2 id="adding-dependencies-its-weird"><a class="header" href="#adding-dependencies-its-weird">Adding dependencies (it's weird)</a></h2>
<p>Ok, we want to spit out a random number along with our hello world message.
No big deal.
Right?</p>
<p>Let's see what happens if we follow the usual pattern.
Back in the terminal, let's add a dependency on the <code>rand</code> crate.
Run the following from your workspace root:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo add rand
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's modify our <code>main.rs</code> to use this.
Maybe now we want something like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    let random_value = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
    println!("Hello, world! Your random number is: {random_value}");
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If we build and run this (say, via <code>cargo run</code>), we get just what we expect!</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Hello, world! Your random number is: 96
</code></pre>
<p>YMMV on the exact output, of course.</p>
<p>Looks great, but there's something interesting going on.</p>
<h2 id="wheres-my-dependency-at"><a class="header" href="#wheres-my-dependency-at">Where's my dependency at?</a></h2>
<p>If you look at your <code>whimsy-bin/Cargo.toml</code>, you'll see that we've now added the dependency, just like we'd expect:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
</code></pre>
<p>So what's the problem?</p>
<p>Well, let's say we have a library package as well as a binary package.
And let's say they both use the <code>rand</code> crate.
There's a danger that the dependencies could get out of sync between each other.</p>
<p>While that's not a problem in itself, it <em>is</em> a problem if the two <code>rand</code> versions are incompatible.
As it turns out, while building a binary, Rust will only ever build <em>one</em> version of a given crate.</p>
<p>If you think about it, this makes sense.
If Rust were to build version <code>rand</code> version <code>0.6.3</code> for the library, and then version <code>0.8.5</code> for the binary, how would we link everything together?</p>
<p>(If you're not familiar with the linking process, then just trust me - this gets hairy real fast.)</p>
<p>So Rust will choose one version of a library to build, then use that version for every library and binary that depend on it.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-solution"><a class="header" href="#whats-the-solution">What's the solution?</a></h3>
<p>The solution to this potential for mismatch is, of course, to use the workspace!</p>
<p>As it turns out, there's a dependencies section in the workspace as well.
We want to move our <code>rand</code> dependency there, and then tell the <code>whimsy-bin</code> project to use the version referenced by the workspace.</p>
<p>Easy enough!
In your workspace's Cargo.toml, add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[workspace.dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
</code></pre>
<p>And now in <code>whimsy-bin/Cargo.toml</code>, modify the dependencies section to look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand.workspace = true
</code></pre>
<p>What we're doing here is telling the <code>whimsy-bin</code> project to use whatever version of <code>rand</code> that's specified in the workspace.</p>
<p>Now, if we were to add the <code>rand</code> dependency to another library in our workspace, we'd just add that same <code>rand.workspace = true</code> line to the library's <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>
<p>This is how we ensure all the different packages in our workspace are compatible, or at least as far as dependencies are concerned.</p>
<h2 id="best-practices"><a class="header" href="#best-practices">Best practices</a></h2>
<p>This is all well and good, but there's one more thing we should take a look at.
Currently, we're specifying version <code>0.8.5</code> of the <code>rand</code> crate.</p>
<p>What does this actually mean?</p>
<p>Well, cargo <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html">dependency version specifications</a> are more complicated than you'd think.
Just saying we want version <code>0.8.5</code> does not guarantee that we'll get exactly that version.</p>
<h3 id="oh-no-its-semver-isnt-it"><a class="header" href="#oh-no-its-semver-isnt-it">Oh no it's semver isn't it</a></h3>
<p>Yes.
Yes it is semver.</p>
<p>If you haven't run into how Rust uses <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/semver.html">semantic versioning</a>, you probably didn't even realize that it could be so strange.</p>
<p>Long story short, specifying your version as the exact string <code>0.8.5</code> really means: Rust is able to use any version of this library that has version <code>0.8.X</code>, where <code>X</code> is any value 5 or greater.</p>
<h4 id="what-do-the-three-numbers-mean-again"><a class="header" href="#what-do-the-three-numbers-mean-again">What do the three numbers mean again?</a></h4>
<p>If you have version <code>X.Y.Z</code> of a library, then you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major version <code>X</code></li>
<li>Minor version <code>Y</code></li>
<li>Patch version <code>Z</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Except when the major version is exactly <code>0</code>, then <code>Y</code> is treated as the major version, and <code>Z</code> as the minor version, with no patch version specification.</p>
<p>(Yes this is a weird and stupid exception, but there actually are good historical reasons for this being the case in the Rust community.
Mostly it boils down to people not wanting to commit to "true" major version <code>1</code> while they're still hammering out the code, so we needed some way to tell
<code>cargo</code> that it was okay to bump the <code>Z</code> value like a minor version if <code>X</code> was zero. Life is grand sometimes.)</p>
<h3 id="so-why-are-we-discussing-this-again"><a class="header" href="#so-why-are-we-discussing-this-again">So why are we discussing this again?</a></h3>
<p>Remember that we're trying to keep our dependencies as compatible as possible - not just in our own workspace packages, but also against those dependencies we pull in as helper libraries.</p>
<p>Now, there are all sorts of ways to "pin" a library to a specific version, to specify specific version ranges, to allow variation in either the major,
minor, or patch version numbers.
But we aren't so concerned about all that, we just want to make sure that Rust doesn't use a completely incompatible version.</p>
<p>As it turns out, you can do this by just chopping off the bits you don't care about.
So if we have version <code>0.8.5</code>, the rules of semver tell us that the crate author should not be committing any "breaking changes" if the next crate version
still starts with <code>0.8</code>. (Defining "breaking changes" is a super complex topic on its own, but not worth diving into here.)</p>
<p>For us, it means that we can relax our requirements a bit in our workspace.
This is a good thing!</p>
<p>Imagine that we release a library into the world.
And let's say that we only specify version <code>0.8</code>.
Then anyone using that library could relying on version <code>0.8.2</code> specifically if they really wanted, and our library would still be compatible.
If we still had <code>0.8.5</code>, that other person wouldn't be able to use our library, because their version wouldn't match ours.
Oh woe be to those who have legacy codebases and requirements!</p>
<h3 id="so-lets-fix-it"><a class="header" href="#so-lets-fix-it">So let's fix it</a></h3>
<p>Let's change how we require the <code>rand</code> crate in our workspace.
Jump into <code>./Cargo.toml</code> and update the rand dependency line to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">rand = "0.8"
</code></pre>
<p>Note that because we're changing it in the workspace, and because all our child projects refer to the version in the workspace, all our projects are updated for free!</p>
<h3 id="theres-always-a-catch"><a class="header" href="#theres-always-a-catch">There's always a catch</a></h3>
<p>But not so fast!
What <em>actually</em> happened when we made that change?</p>
<p>This is the realm of <code>Cargo.lock</code>, a mysterious, little-understood denizen of the dark forest we call Cargo-internals.</p>
<h2 id="cargolock"><a class="header" href="#cargolock">Cargo.lock</a></h2>
<p>You've probably noticed this file from time to time.
You've probably also been told not to edit it.
In fact, it even comes with a warning sign to any small children who think they see candy inside:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># This file is automatically @generated by Cargo.
# It is not intended for manual editing.
version = 3
</code></pre>
<p>Those are the first few lines of the Cargo.lock file for our project.</p>
<div id="admonition-quote" class="admonition admonish-quote" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-quote-title">
<div class="admonition-title">
<div id="admonition-quote-title">

<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="#admonition-quote"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>not intended for manual editing</p>
<p>- <em>Cargo.lock, 2024, laughing probably</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let's explore this file a little bit to see if we can better understand what it's doing.</p>
<h3 id="dependency-entries"><a class="header" href="#dependency-entries">Dependency entries</a></h3>
<p>If we take a look at Cargo.lock in an editor, we see a bunch of entries, for lots of dependencies.
In our case, the first such dependency looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[package]]
name = "byteorder"
version = "1.5.0"
source = "registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"
checksum = "1fd0f2584146f6f2ef48085050886acf353beff7305ebd1ae69500e27c67f64b"
</code></pre>
<p>What the heck?
We never asked for a <code>byteorder</code> dependency.
What's going on?</p>
<p>Well, whenever you aren't sure why something is showing up in your project, you can use a handy tool called <code>cargo tree</code> to sort it out.
Let's try it.</p>
<p>From your terminal, type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo tree
</code></pre>
<p>You should see some super fancy ASCII graphics, and also some boring dependency chains.
Probably something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">whimsy-bin v0.1.0 (/home/code/whimsy/whimsy-bin)
└── rand v0.8.5
    ├── libc v0.2.162
    ├── rand_chacha v0.3.1
    │   ├── ppv-lite86 v0.2.20
    │   │   └── zerocopy v0.7.35
    │   │       ├── byteorder v1.5.0
    │   │       └── zerocopy-derive v0.7.35 (proc-macro)
    │   │           ├── proc-macro2 v1.0.89
    │   │           │   └── unicode-ident v1.0.13
    │   │           ├── quote v1.0.37
    │   │           │   └── proc-macro2 v1.0.89 (*)
    │   │           └── syn v2.0.87
    │   │               ├── proc-macro2 v1.0.89 (*)

    │       └── getrandom v0.2.15

    │           └── libc v0.2.162
    └── rand_core v0.6.4 (*)
</code></pre>
<p>After a quick inspection, we can see that <code>byteorder</code> is being brought into our project because <code>zerocopy</code> uses it, and <code>ppv-lite86</code> uses <code>zerocopy</code>, <code>rand_chacha</code> uses <code>ppv-lite86</code>, and finally the <code>rand</code> crate uses <code>rand_chacha</code>.</p>
<p>So it makes sense why <code>byteorder</code> is in our dependencies, just a bit hidden.
(This is one of the things I love about <code>cargo</code>: it manages all of this for us.)</p>
<h3 id="okay-so-what-about-the-cargolock-entry"><a class="header" href="#okay-so-what-about-the-cargolock-entry">Okay, so what about the <code>Cargo.lock</code> entry?</a></h3>
<p>Let's take another look at that entry in <code>Cargo.lock</code>, now that we understand why <code>byteorder</code> is there at all.
It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[package]]
name = "byteorder"
version = "1.5.0"
source = "registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"
checksum = "1fd0f2584146f6f2ef48085050886acf353beff7305ebd1ae69500e27c67f64b"
</code></pre>
<p>We can guess what the checksum is there for (security stuff mumble mumble).
We can even see where it pulled the crate data from, in the <code>source</code> line.</p>
<p>We also see a version.
And it's a fully specified semver version too.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is what <code>Cargo.lock</code> is for.</p>
<p>Remember how we changed our <code>rand</code> version dependency to <code>0.8</code> instead of <code>0.8.5</code>?
Well, if we hunt down the section in <code>Cargo.lock</code> that references <code>rand</code>, we see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[package]]
name = "rand"

</code></pre>
<p>First, we pat ourselves on the back because we already knew that <code>rand_chacha</code> was a required dependency, because we went full nerd with <code>cargo tree</code>.</p>
<p>But then, we see that the version says <code>0.8.5</code>. Not <code>0.8</code>, but the full <code>0.8.5</code>.</p>
<h3 id="but-hang-on-we-didnt-change-anything-since-we-edited-the-version-number"><a class="header" href="#but-hang-on-we-didnt-change-anything-since-we-edited-the-version-number">But hang on, we didn't change anything since we edited the version number!</a></h3>
<p>Just to make sure this is real, let's try an experiment.</p>
<p>As it happens, <code>Cargo.toml</code> isn't <em>needed</em> when you do a build.
It can be regenerated at any time when you need it.</p>
<p>So let's Lazarus this thing.
In your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rm Cargo.lock
</code></pre>
<p>Now do anything that needs the dependencies to be fully fleshed out.
You can run <code>cargo check</code>, <code>cargo build</code> or something like that.</p>
<p>Now take a look at the <code>rand</code> entry in your regenerated <code>Cargo.lock</code>.
It should still reference <code>0.8.5</code>.</p>
<p>So what <code>Cargo.lock</code> is doing is now a bit more clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>It "reifies" our dependency version numbers from our version requests in <code>Cargo.toml</code>
<ul>
<li>This is a fancy word meaning it takes the fluffy semver specification we have in our <code>Cargo.toml</code> and picks a real version of the library in question</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It keeps track of what version we have already downloaded so we don't have to redownload every build</li>
<li>(Some other magic, but it's not too important at this point)</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a little more to the story, like being able to make fully reproducible builds (because you have such detailed info to compare against), and some other things.
But hopefully now you'll understand better why <code>Cargo.lock</code> is there and what it's used for.</p>

<p>We covered an awful lot about dependencies here, probably more than you wanted to know.
But when you feel like you have a good handle on things, let's move onto something that can actually make your life a bit better.</p>
