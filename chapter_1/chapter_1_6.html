<p>In this chapter, we're going to learn about <a href="#crate-level-docs">crate documentation</a>, configuring <a href="#configuring-lints-on-a-workspace-level">lint levels in our workspace</a>, the <a href="#the-warnings">pitfalls</a> of the <code>restriction</code> group,
and I'll suggest a <a href="#choosing-a-good-subset-of-lints-to-enable">workspace lint setup</a> that strikes a balance between pedanticness and ergonomics that works for me at least.</p>
<h2 id="going-back-to-basics"><a class="header" href="#going-back-to-basics">Going back to basics</a></h2>
<p>Ok, let's take a quick step back.
Because there's some really interesting info we can get from even the default new <code>cargo</code> project.</p>
<h2 id="hello-world-again"><a class="header" href="#hello-world-again">Hello, world, again</a></h2>
<p>Let's go back to our original "hello world" style <code>main</code> function.
Remove all the code from <code>whimsy-bin/src/main.rs</code>, and replace it with this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}</code></pre></pre>
<p>You should also remove the dependency on <code>rand</code> in both the workspace (<code>./Cargo.toml</code>) and the package (<code>whimsy-bin/Cargo.toml</code>).
This is as simple as removing the line referring to <code>rand</code> in the dependencies section of each file.</p>
<h2 id="checking-our-code-with-clippy-pedantic"><a class="header" href="#checking-our-code-with-clippy-pedantic">Checking our code with Clippy pedantic</a></h2>
<p>You can compile and run this program just fine.
You can even get clean results back from both <code>cargo check</code> and even <code>cargo clippy -- -W clippy::pedantic</code>.</p>
<p>So what could we possibly improve about this setup?
This is basically the simplest possible workspace setup you could have.</p>
<h3 id="more-lints"><a class="header" href="#more-lints">More lints</a></h3>
<p>Well, yes, this is the <em>simplest</em> possible workspace.
But it's by no means the most <em>complete</em> from a best practices point of view.</p>
<p>Try running the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo clippy -- -W missing_docs
</code></pre>
<p>You'll get results similar to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">    Checking whimsy-bin v0.1.0 (/home/code/whimsy/whimsy-bin)

</code></pre>
<p>Ok, fair enough.
We're missing crate level documentation.
In our case, the crate root is <code>whimsy-bin/src/main.rs</code>, so it seems like a good place to put some.</p>
<h3 id="crate-level-docs"><a class="header" href="#crate-level-docs">Crate level docs</a></h3>
<p>Remember how we were able to create outer attributes, by putting a <code>!</code> after the initial <code>#</code>?</p>
<p>And remember how this meant that the attribute applied to the entire item the attribute was declared in?</p>
<p>Well something very similar happens with docs.
But in this case, we put the <code>!</code> after the <code>//</code> comment signifier.</p>
<p>Add the comments in the following snippet to your <code>main.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">//! whimsy-bin
//!
//! This program exists solely for the amusement, entertainment, and education of the programmer.
//! In that sense, it's very much like a childrens book, perhaps about a young lass daydreaming about a strange and wonderful land.

/// The main entry point of our whimsical adventure
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that we are using <code>//!</code> here for the first comment section.
This is an "outer" comment basically. It applies the comment to the entire crate, instead of just this file.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to the <code>///</code> style comment we have put on our <code>main</code> function.
This is an "inner" comment, meaning that this comment applies only to the <code>main</code> function, and not the crate as a whole.</p>
<div id="admonition-viewing-doc-comments" class="admonition admonish-tip" role="note" aria-labelledby="admonition-viewing-doc-comments-title">
<div class="admonition-title">
<div id="admonition-viewing-doc-comments-title">
<p>Viewing doc comments</p>
</div>
<a class="admonition-anchor-link" href="#admonition-viewing-doc-comments"></a>
</div>
<div>
<p>These triple-slash comments are part of Rust's "doc comment" system.
There's a lot to say about Rust's documentation system, but for our purposes, just note that it's robust enough to create
all the documentation you're used to seeing when you check out a new crate on <code>crates.io</code> or <code>docs.rs</code></p>
</div>
</div>
<h4 id="real-world-example"><a class="header" href="#real-world-example">Real world example</a></h4>
<p>Let's take a quick peek at one very common crate, called <code>serde</code>.
We'll be using this crate later in the book, but right now it doesn't matter what it <em>does</em>, only what it's comments look like.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/"><code>serde docs</code></a> at <code>docs.rs</code>.
Pretty nice, huh?</p>
<p>Well, these were generated automatically from the doc comments provided by the crate authors.</p>
<p>Near the top of the page, just under the "Crate serde" comment, click on the <a href="https://docs.rs/serde/latest/src/serde/lib.rs.html#1-348">Source</a> link.
You'll be taken to a copy of the code for the latest version of the crate.
You should see something that starts like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>//! # Serde
//!
//! Serde is a framework for ***ser***ializing and ***de***serializing Rust data
//! structures efficiently and generically.
<span class="boring">}</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>See how that's exactly what displays on the main docs page?
Very cool!</p>
<p>The takeaway is that if you are planning on releasing your crate to the world, or even having a larger team of contributors,
it may be worth your time to set a convention of using doc comments.
You can then build your documentation directly from the source tree you're working on, even if it's a completely local branch of the code.</p>
<p>And how do you help enforce this convention?
By using the <code>missing_docs</code> lint, of course!</p>
<h2 id="configuring-lints-on-a-workspace-level"><a class="header" href="#configuring-lints-on-a-workspace-level">Configuring lints on a workspace level</a></h2>
<p>Fortunately, we can set up our project to the <code>missing_docs</code> lint whenever we run <code>cargo check</code>.</p>
<p>In your workspace <code>Cargo.toml</code>, add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[workspace.lints.rust]
missing_docs = "warn"
</code></pre>
<p>Then, in our package configuration, in <code>whimsy-bin/Cargo.toml</code>, we can just ask for whatever lints are configured at the workspace level:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[lints]
workspace = true
</code></pre>
<p>Now, whenever we run <code>cargo check</code>, we will have the <code>missing_docs</code> lint warning us when we are being lazy (or just forgetful).</p>
<h3 id="clippy-specific-lints"><a class="header" href="#clippy-specific-lints">Clippy specific lints</a></h3>
<p>Ok, this works great for built-in Rust lints.
What about clippy lints?</p>
<p>The mechanism is pretty similar.
In your workspace <code>Cargo.toml</code>, add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[workspace.lints.clippy]
pedantic = "warn"
restriction = "warn"
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, let's give it a spin.
Try running <code>cargo clippy</code> with no other options.</p>
<p>You'll probably see the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">    Checking whimsy-bin v0.1.0 (/home/code/whimsy/whimsy-bin)

<p>Yikes!
I certainly didn't expect to get <em>two</em> warnings from a simple hello world program!
What's going on?</p>
<h3 id="the-warnings"><a class="header" href="#the-warnings">The warnings</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately, the first warning tells us right away what's going on.
The <code>restriction</code> lint group isn't really meant to be enabled in full.
That's because these are lints that are intended to be specifically enabled in a given project, based on that project's needs.</p>
<p>In fact, there are lints in the restriction group that expressly contradict each other:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>restriction::semicolon_inside_block</code> will warn you if you write something like <code>unsafe { f(x) };</code></li>
<li><code>restriction::semicolon_outside_block</code> will warn you if you write something like <code>unsafe { f(x); }</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And to boot, each will tell you to use the style of the other!</p>
<p>As it turns out, it's intended that you only use <em>one</em> of these two.
They are considered mutually exclusive.
And they're there to simply enforce a coding standard.</p>
<p>So you can see, the <code>restriction</code> group really should not be enabled as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="the-println-warning"><a class="header" href="#the-println-warning">The <code>println</code> warning</a></h3>
<p>In this case, the second warning is a slightly more interesting one.
This is notifying us that we're committing the cardinal sin of using <code>println!</code>.</p>
<p>Ok, ok - if we <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#print_stdout">follow the link</a> for that specific lint, we can see the reasoning.
It is true that you generally don't want to leave debugging statements in your code.</p>
<p>So both of these warnings make sense. Now the question is what to do about them.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-a-good-subset-of-lints-to-enable"><a class="header" href="#choosing-a-good-subset-of-lints-to-enable">Choosing a good subset of lints to enable</a></h2>
<p>The short answer for me is usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on everything in <code>pedantic</code> as a warning</li>
<li>Enable only those lints in <code>restriction</code> that I believe make sense for general programming</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a super subjective decision.
Every programmer is going to have a "pedanticness" level that they're comfortable with.
In fact, every project is probably going to have a level that's appropriate, and it can vary quite a bit.</p>
<p>But we're not just every programmer.
We want to be treated bad.
We want to be whipped.
Chained.
And we want to call Clippy "master".</p>
<p>Ok, that might be a bit hyperbolic, but I do tend to run with more lints than most.
You can often run into false positives, but I like to see these lints when they show up, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of them have decent reasoning behind them, which I can learn from (both Rust specific, and general programming practices)</li>
<li>Solving the issue can also introduce you to new techniques, even from the suggested resolutions in the warning output</li>
<li>It keeps me following good code hygiene and best practices</li>
</ul>
<p>So check out the list of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/listing/allowed-by-default.html">allowed-by-default</a> rustc lints,
as well as the Clippy info we went over before.
See if you can come up with a collection that works for you.</p>

<p>This is a big list, and you don't need to understand every individual lint.
Far better is to run with a list like this, then dig into each warning as it comes up, so you understand why it's there and what it's warning you about.</p>
<p>You are free to modify this list however you like.
Check out the link explanation on any that you don't understand from the name only, to see if you might like to keep it.</p>
<p>At any rate, I'll use this for the remainder of this book.</p>
<p>Add the above to your workspace's <code>Cargo.toml</code>, and then make sure you have your project-specific <code>Cargo.toml</code> set up to use the workspace settings.</p>
<h2 id="applying-our-new-lints"><a class="header" href="#applying-our-new-lints">Applying our new lints</a></h2>
<p>So now we've added some more checks, let's see what happens!
Run the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo clippy
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we did not supply any extra parameters for extra lints here - Clippy is grabbing them from the package configuration that we just set.</p>
<p>You'll probably see something like the following:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Ok, this is interesting! We see that this entire set of warnings is coming from the <code>clippy::cargo</code> lint group.</p>
<p>What these are telling us is that we haven't configured our workspace or packages to best practices yet.
This is <em>exactly</em> the kind of lint I like to see!</p>
<h3 id="package-metadata"><a class="header" href="#package-metadata">Package metadata</a></h3>
<p>If you look at <code>whimsy-bin/Cargo.toml</code> at the moment, it probably looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = "whimsy-bin"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]

[lints]
workspace = true
</code></pre>
<p>But according to the Clippy output we just saw, there look to be a number of fields that we can add to provide even better metadata.
Try changing your config to look more like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = "whimsy-bin"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
description = "A whimsical program for learning Rust and Cargo"
license = "None"
repository = "http://localhost"
readme = "README.md"
keywords = ["whimsy", "learning", "Rust", "Cargo"]
categories = ["education"]

[dependencies]

[lints]
workspace = true
</code></pre>
<p>Of particular note are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>license</code> field, where you could pick things like <code>license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"</code> if you wanted to. For now, we'll just set it to none.</li>
<li>the <code>repository</code> field, where you would specify the repo you're using, often a github link</li>
<li>the <code>readme</code> field is currently pointing to <code>README.md</code>, a file that doesn't exist. That's okay. It doesn't need to be there, but it's probably a good idea to create one anyway.</li>
<li>the <code>keywords</code> field can contain anything you like, that might be helpful for people searching to find your crate</li>
<li>the <code>categories</code> field contains a list of <a href="https://crates.io/category_slugs">"slugs"</a> from <code>crates.io</code>, and need to be from that list of sanctioned slugs exactly</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, now that we've got these fields in place, and we have a rough understanding of what they're for, let's try that again.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo clippy
</code></pre>
<p>This should now produce a clean lint pass!</p>
<h2 id="be-the-workspace-danny"><a class="header" href="#be-the-workspace-danny">Be the Workspace, Danny</a></h2>
<p>There's just one more thing to cover.
While this is working very nicely, we can see that with the exception of the <code>name</code> and <code>version</code> fields,
it's likely that all the crates in our workspace might share values for some or all of the other fields.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can do just like we have done previously - move these into a section in the workspace <code>Cargo.toml</code>, then tell
the package <code>Cargo.toml</code> to inherit from the workspace.</p>
<p>So in your workspace <code>./Cargo.toml</code> we want something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[workspace.package]
edition = "2021"
description = "A whimsical program for learning Rust and Cargo"
license = "None"
repository = "http://localhost"
readme = "README.md"
keywords = ["whimsy", "learning", "Rust", "Cargo"]
categories = ["education"]
</code></pre>
<p>And hopefully it won't surprise you to see how we can use it. In your package <code>whimsy-bin/Cargo.toml</code>, modify the current section to look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = "whimsy-bin"
version = "0.1.0"
edition.workspace = true
description.workspace = true
license.workspace = true
repository.workspace = true
readme.workspace = true
keywords.workspace = true
categories.workspace = true
</code></pre>
<p>This shouldn't look like magic - we're just telling the package to inherit most of the fields from their definitions in the workspace.</p>
<h3 id="clippy-master"><a class="header" href="#clippy-master">Clippy Master</a></h3>
<p>And now, with all this done, Clippy is no longer making us call it master. <em>We</em> are making Clippy call <em>us</em> master.</p>
<p>When you have internalized this new locus of power, we can move on.</p>
